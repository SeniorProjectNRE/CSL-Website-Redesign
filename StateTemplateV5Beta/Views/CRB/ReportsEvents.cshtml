Anne Neville, director of the California Research Bureau, moderates a thought-provoking discussion with Nicholas Davis, head of Society and Innovation at the World Economic Forum in Geneva; Rachel Hatch, research director of the 10-Year Forecast at the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto; and California's chief economist, Irena Asmundson.

                                        California enacted Assembly Bill 2494 (2014) to expand the legal remedies available against frivolous litigation. Specifically, the statute revived California Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, which allows parties in lawsuits to file motions requesting sanctions against bad faith legal actions. This report, mandated by AB 2494, examines the statute's impact in the first two years after passage on the frequency of requests for sanctions.

                                        The Medical Board of California protects the health of Californians by ensuring that practicing physicians in the state are licensed and regulated. Conducted at the request of the Medical Board, this report looked at 10 years of disciplinary data to see if there was any relationship between physician race and disciplinary outcomes. Latino/a and Black physicians were both more likely to receive complaints and more likely to see those complaints escalate to investigations. Latino/a physicians were also more likely to see those investigations result in discipline. Asian physicians had a reduced likelihood of receiving complaints, or of those complaints escalating to investigations.

                                        Californians voted in 100 Assembly and Senate races in the November 2016 election. Thirty-one new members were elected to the Legislature, shifting the demographics of both bodies. The Assembly is now majority-minority (54%). The number of women legislators decreased by 5, bringing the total to 26, the lowest since 1991-1992. This report was updated on December 5, 2016.

                                        Since Proposition 13 passed in 1978, California has not had another major revamping of its tax system despite a widely acknowledged need for an overhaul. As a result, the state's fiscal health relies disproportionately on personal income tax, and sales and use tax. This paper, which was originally published in an appendix to Controller Betty Yee's <a href="/crb/16/Comprehensive_Tax_Reform_in_California_A_Contextual_Framework_06_16.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Comprehensive Tax Reform in California: A Contextual Framework,"</a> looks at the frequent incremental changes on taxation California has made, including the Legislature considering an average of 245 tax bills per year over the last two decades.

                                        State legislation allowing city attorneys in a pilot program to evict tenants for drug- and weapon-related nuisances began almost two decades ago in California. Four cities currently participate in the program&mdash;Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland and Sacramento. Under the pilot program city attorney-sponsored evictions are permitted when tenants "create a nuisance on the property by using or allowing the premises to be used" for unlawful firearms or drug activity. In 2015, city attorneys used the program 64 times against 74 tenants, a marked decrease from the 235 times cities used the program in 2011. This report reviews program use by each city and provides tenant demographic information and other data.

                                        Under the social model of recovery from substance abuse disorders, the sober living home has become an important resource for persons in recovery in California and elsewhere. Since the law generally treats sober living homes as residences rather than treatment facilities, state and local governments do not require them to carry licenses or impose other regulations outside of the general regulations on housing, zoning and land use. The proliferation of sober living homes in some places has raised concerns that they are being operated more like businesses than homes, impinging on the residential use and character of areas where they are concentrated. This report explores recent efforts to regulate sober living homes at the state and local level, the legal challenges that local ordinances in California have faced and policy options for regulation of these establishments at the state level.

                                        Governments around the world are making data more accessible and useable. Releasing data isn't a matter of just flipping a switch, however. Public and private organizations alike need to think about privacy, data quality and a host of other factors. This paper explores successful open data projects at the California Health and Human Services Agency and the State Controller's Office. It reports on their successes, challenges and outcomes. Using shared lessons from these projects and others, the paper also summarizes current state policy on open data, including procurement policies; highlights various privacy laws and guidelines; and provides sample organizational structures for open data teams.

                                        California law has historically prevented corporations from practicing medicine, which includes the employment of physicians. This long-standing ban on the corporate practice of medicine remains in effect, though the state has created a number of exceptions for certain types of organizations. This report explores the current state of the ban in California. It reviews the impact of the ban in a changing healthcare landscape that now emphasizes integrated service delivery, and explores the types of conflicts of interest &ndash; in addition to employment &ndash; that physicians and other medical professionals face. The report builds upon the policy options the Research Bureau discussed in its original 2007 paper.

                                        In 2014, women represented 13.3 percent of board directors on California's largest company boards, up from 8.8 percent in 2005. The continued underrepresentation of women on California boards is widespread even as it varies significantly across counties and industries. This research brief describes  international, national and California programs to increase the number of women board directors, analyzes women directors by location and industry, and offers options California could undertake to increase women�s representation on corporate boards.

                                        California is home to the largest number of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) veterans in the country &ndash; more than double the next closest state. When these service members left active duty military service, the Department of Defense issued them discharge papers that characterized their military service. For LGBT veterans, discharge papers reflecting outdated gender identities and outdated policies &ndash; such as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" &ndash; can cause a loss of access to earned military benefits and services.

                                        Results presented here bring together the experiences and analyses of California leaders in LGBT and veteran communities, including LGBT veterans, service providers, other organizations and spouses. This white paper makes public the policies and programs that a cross-section of LGBT veterans, allies and service organizations recommend to reduce discrimination and expand equal opportunity for LGBT veterans. These suggestions include recommendations for federal, state and local actions gathered at a two-day California Department of Veterans Affairs LGBT veterans leadership forum. Examples include housing accommodations for trauma survivors, nondiscrimination employment protections, cultural sensitivity training, college campus resource centers and an expedited process to upgrade discharge papers that "out" LGBT veterans' sexual orientations or transgender identities.

                                        This is the third report on California State Parks, prepared at the request of the Senate Natural Resources & Water Committee and the Assembly Water, Parks & Wildlife Committee. It describes how the state could change the peace officer requirements for state park superintendents and state park rangers, and raises questions about the effects of such changes on the structure and culture of the Department of Parks and Recreation. Recent reports by the Little Hoover Commission and the Parks Forward Commission recommended these changes as important steps to transforming DPR into a new operating model built around shared management, innovation, and greater transparency.

                                        This report presents information from the 2013 California Women Veteran Survey. The results suggest there is an opportunity for increased outreach and education among women veteran communities. Most respondents were unaware of all the state's veteran-related benefits and services to which they are entitled. Some of those who may be eligible for service-connected disability compensation had not filed claims. Many who had not used U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare reported they did not realize they were eligible.

                                        Water is an integral part of hydraulic fracturing, an enhanced technique for oil and gas recovery that has garnered much media attention in recent years. Sources and uses of water vary, depending on the type of event, geographic site, and geologic situation. The second in our series on hydraulic fracturing in California, this Short Subject discusses the role of water in this popular technique: where it comes from, how it is used, the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids, and what happens to the fluids after the event.

                                        As the Affordable Care Act expands health care benefits to millions of uninsured and underinsured people, lowering costs of care has become a pressing issue. One approach to this problem is to reduce duplicative laboratory tests and prevent medication errors by exchanging health information across different care settings. This brief defines major terminologies associated with health information technology and discusses federal efforts to encourage the adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems among physicians and hospitals.

                                        Aerospace is one of the nation's standout industries, and one in which California has enjoyed an outsized role. Over $31 billion in aerospace manufacturing production occurred in California in 2011, representing 6.3 percent of all manufacturing activity in the state.  Out of $183 billion in aerospace production in the United States in 2011, California represented 17 percent of that total. New trends point to continued growth in California's aerospace industry, with the recent success of commercial space flight companies such as SpaceX and Scaled Composites building testing and manufacturing facilities in the state.

Funding for support of the state park system has increased although the proportion of General Fund declined, as did reliance on fee revenue. Most of the growth in the Department's budget is attributable to the growth in special funds.

California's minimum wage has historically tracked closely with the federal rate, and is currently approximately 110% of the federal wage. California law also provides additional protections for tipped workers, preventing the inclusion of tips in calculations of wage rates. There have also been an increasing number of municipalities establishing higher minimum wage rates on their own, and passing living wage laws, which protect employees of business that contract with the city or county government.

While California women have higher levels of education than they did in prior years, disparities across different race/ethnic backgrounds remain.

                                        AB1384 (Havice, Ch.613, Stats. 1997-1998) established the legal capacity for city attorneys in five cities to sue for unlawful detainer (an eviction suit) when property owners were either unwilling or unable to evict a tenant arrested for drug or weapons crimes. The program was designed to facilitate the effective and efficient removal of criminals from neighborhoods. This report was produced in response to AB 530 (Krekorian, Ch. 244, Stats. 2009-2010), requiring CRB to evaluate the pilot Unlawful Detainer program.

                                        Current reporting requirements and practices make it difficult to assess the overall merits of the UD pilot programs. Few UD notices were filed in court by city attorneys, a finding consistent with CRB's first report. Weapon-related UD notices appear to be about twice as likely to lead to subsequent court action as drug-related notices, although many more drug-related notices were issued.

                                        California is home to approximately 106,000 military children (children with at least one parent in the Armed Forces). The Department of Defense (DOD) attempts to provide child care to 80 percent of military children aged 13 or less. The other 20 percent of child care is provided through community providers. In some areas of California, there is not enough community child care to bridge this gap. This brief explores the child care needs of California's military families, the issues around licensing DOD-apporved child care versus California state approved child care and the costs of child care for military families.

A significant portion of older Californians from each race/ethnic group is overweight and suffers from issues related to economic security. These concerns are generally more common among those without a college education. And, while 25 percent of those ages 50 and over report providing care to a family member or friend who has a long-term illness or disability, fewer than 5 percent report using respite care services.

Despite that 86 percent of California women ages 50-64 and 99 percent of those 65 and older have healthcare coverage, some report not going to the doctor because of the cost.

                                        Governor Edmund G. ("Jerry") Brown established the Interagency Council on Veterans (ICV) in order to coordinate state-level activities to improve services and outreach for veterans. Participants of the ICV met in February 2012 over two days to discuss the service needs, gaps and obstacles in service and outline potential next steps for improving services to veterans. This paper analyzes the contents of the meeting discussions and presents key findings from that analysis. Participants in the ICV identified the need for funding, increasing data sharing and data capture, improving transition programs and increasing public outreach as critical needs for the veteran community.

                                        California has the largest number (167,000) and greatest proportion (9.5 percent) of female veterans in the country. Currently, who these women are and what they need is generally unknown. The California Research Bureau, along with CalVet and the Commission on the Status of Women, conducted a survey of nearly 900 women veterans in California to find out who they are and what they need. This report presents the preliminary findings from the 2011 survey of these women veterans.

                                        Charter schools are overseen by authorizers. In California, an authorizer is generally a school district, but may be a county office of education or the State Board of Education. As of June 2011, California had 293 authorizers overseeing 911 charter schools. In SB537 (Ch.650, Stats. of 2007) the Legislature mandated the California Research Bureau review the practices of authorizers in California, examine best practices in authorizing, review the current funding structure for authorizers and submit to the Legislature a report on key elements and actual costs of charter authorizing. This report provides CRB's findings from its investigation of California's authorizers. Additionally, it provides several options to the Legislature for improving charter oversight.

                                        AB1384 (Havice, Ch.613, Stats. 1997-1998) established the legal capacity for city attorneys in five cities to sue for unlawful detainer (an eviction suit) when property owners were either unwilling or unable to evict a tenant arrested for drug or weapons crimes. The program was designed to facilitate the effective and efficient removal of criminals from neighborhoods. This report was produced in response to AB 530 (Krekorian, Ch. 244, Stats. 2009-2010), requiring CRB to evaluate the pilot Unlawful Detainer program.

The data showed that the program was utilized approximately 300 times across the three cities that opted to participate in the pilot program in 2010. The most common result of an unlawful detainer suit was that the tenant vacated the property prior to the full prosecution of the suit.

                                        <em>Adrianna Muir, Ph.D. (CRB-11-001, January, 2011)</em><br />
                                        Coastal Aquatic Invasive Species (CAIS) increasingly threaten California's coastal estuarine and marine habitats. With no natural predators, these non-native species become abundant, resulting in costly, negative impacts on infrastructure, human health, and natural ecosystems. Seeking assistance in implementing the California Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan, the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee, requested that the California Research Bureau craft a framework for understanding the challenges that coastal aquatic invasive species create for California. In the resulting report, Managing Coastal Aquatic Invasive Species in California: Existing Policies and Policy Gaps, CRB Senior Environmental Policy Fellow, Adrianna Muir, Ph.D. highlights the CAIS policy and management challenges facing California. The report focuses on opportunities for improvement over six general policy categories (Authority, Prevention, Research, Control, Implementation, and Coordination) and addresses the vectors, or pathways, through which invasive species are introduced.

                                        The California Research Bureau (CRB) sponsored this seminar series with financial support from the California HealthCare Foundation. The purpose of the grant was to inform a broad group of legislators, and legislative and administrative staff about policy aspects of achieving universal healthcare coverage in California. The overarching goal of the seminars was to highlight the importance of, and necessity for, cost containment to achieve and maintain a near-universal healthcare coverage program. The grant provided funding for three seminars on topics related to achieving universal healthcare coverage in California: Health Information Technology-Electronic Health Records (HIT-EHR), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), and Individual Mandate (IM). The seminars were conducted on a policy-neutral and nonpartisan basis.

                                        Women represent over 15 percent of the active duty and reserve forces of the military, and make up over 220,000 of the 1.8 million troops serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) &ndash; the largest wartime deployment for U.S. women. Following their military service, often in combat conditions, women are returning to their roles as private citizens - wives, mothers, caregivers, workers &ndash; in unprecedented numbers. Women veterans share many of the short- and long-term physical and emotional consequences and needs that their male counterparts face as a result of serving their country. In addition, they have unique experiences and needs as female veterans. The report describes the state's more than 167,000 women veterans (eight percent of the total veteran population); it identifies the challenges these veterans face, the primary services they need, and barriers they encounter. This report also explains the federal, state, and local service delivery structures that provide benefits and services to veterans, and provides additional resource materials.

The CRB identified five distinct elements: a) an assessment of demand for a program; b) the establishment of working relationships among institutions and stakeholders; c) written policies stating a clear commitment to academic goals, transparency, and communication; d) identification of long-term funding streams; and e) a plan for increasing enrollment. The report includes an overview of California-Mexico student and faculty study abroad programs currently being offered in California's public universities and community colleges.

                                        Over 46 million Americans are without healthcare coverage. The number of uninsured is increasing with the growth of unemployment and stagnation of employer-based coverage. Healthcare cost growth continues to outpace growth in wages. The individual mandate is a policy option that could significantly reduce the number of uninsured in the United States and lead to universal health care coverage. An individual mandate would require every citizen to obtain health insurance, be it through an employer, an individual plan, a purchasing pool, or a public plan. This report will discuss how such a mandate could work, what it would cost. It also will review the pros and cons of the individual mandate as well as the availability, affordability and enforcement that would come from such a mandate.

                                        When will the pain end? Not until 2010, when employment losses bottom out and housing prices start rising again. In the spreadsheets accompanying this brief report, data for 57 counties are available at <a href="http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/09/foreclosures09Q1.xls">Foreclosures09Q1.xls</a> (Excel) and <a href="http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/09/foreclosures09Q1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foreclosures09Q1.pdf</a> (PDF).The latest CRB estimate of California foreclosures is 1.1 million for the "cycle" or period 2007-2012, but total "lost" homes will reach 1.4 million. Lenders are trying to avoid the expense of foreclosures, sometimes giving cash incentives to those who are in default and voluntarily mail back the keys. Lenders are also becoming more open to short sales. In these two ways, lenders cut short the long foreclosure process. Some 300,000 units will be lost through jingle mail (deeds surrendered in lieu of foreclosure) or through short sales (principal forbearance that allows underwater homeowners to sell the home for less than the mortgage balance).

                                        The United States spends a much higher percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on healthcare than any other country. Nearly 50 percent of the increase in healthcare costs is attributable to the introduction of new technologies in the practice of medicine. However the rapid introduction of new technologies has not been accompanied by an improvement in health outcomes, suggesting the need to review the effectiveness of these investments. This report describes the process of assessing health technology and identifies national and state agencies and organizations that currently engage in health technology assessment. Finally, the report discusses a proposal to create a centralized body dedicated to the formal scrutiny of innovative (and existing) healthcare technologies and services.

                                        What does the geographic distribution of state spending look like? Are there regions of the state that receive more than their "fair share" of state funds? How is a region's "fair share" defined and calculated? This report examines the geographic distribution of state spending across nine regions: the San Francisco Bay Area, Central Coast, Far North, Inland Empire, San Joaquin Valley, Sacramento Metro, San Diego, Sierras and South Coast. State expenditures are presented for major program areas such as health, education, public assistance, social services, and transportation. (The same fiscal year, FY 2002-03, is used wherever possible.) The many detailed tables provide a new perspective on state expenditures, one that has not been previously analyzed.

                                        Foreclosures have soared in the past three quarters. Eleven counties account for 78 percent of the state's foreclosures. In the spreadsheets accompanying this brief report, data for 57 counties are available at <a href="http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/08/foreclosure.xls">Foreclosure.xls</a> (Excel) and <a href="http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/08/foreclosure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foreclosure.pdf </a>(PDF). Los Angeles has recorded 42,800 foreclosures in this housing downturn, which began in 2006, while the state has lost 288,491 homes to foreclosure. This update of two earlier reports contains sales data and home prices for individual counties and two scenarios of housing demand for the state in 2010. Foreclosures are now are likely to exceed 500,000 in the years through 2012, not including short sales or deeds in lieu of foreclosure. These other types of "lost" homes were the subject of an earlier, Sept. 18th PowerPoint presentation available <a href="http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/08/foreclosure.html">here</a>.

                                        This report, which was requested by Assembly Member Jose Solorio, Chair of the Public Safety Committee, examines California's county camps and ranches for juvenile offenders in the context of recent reforms of the state's juvenile justice system. There are different models of county probation camps, including conventional camps, wilderness camps, military (boot camps), and small residential treatment facilities (known as the Missouri model). We describe the different models as implemented by California counties, with information about length of stay requirements and treatment options. When possible, we also describe the educational and vocational requirements and programs provided by the camps, and examine the availability of health and mental health services.

                                        This report explores current Medical Board of California public disclosure laws, regulations and practices; and presents policy options for improving public access to information about physicians in support of the MBC's public protection mandate. The report presents new statistical findings on physician attributes associated with higher odds of facing formal disciplinary charges. Additionally, we review academic research on the incidence of medical errors, which suggests that patients harmed by negligent or incompetent care rarely file lawsuits or formal complaints against their caregivers. We present a number of policy options for expanding public disclosure about California physicians and enhancing the MBC's public outreach program. This report was mandated by SB 1438 (Chapter 223, Statutes of 2006), sponsored by Senator Figueroa.

                                        School districts are central players in the child care delivery system: they operate a mix of child care centers and programs, serve a range of children of different ages, and fund their programs from a variety of federal, state, and local sources. This report provides a range of programmatic and fiscal information about the federal and state funding sources for child care that are available to California's K-12 public school districts. The focus is on funding that pays for basic care and supervision, or what is considered the child care program "slot" or space. Assembly Member Mark Leno requested that CRB compile this information to assist school districts throughout the state, in addition to policymakers.

                                        Achieving universal health care coverage will require significant changes in the health care system. There is an expectation that widespread adoption of Health Information Technology-Electronic Medical Records will play an important role in transforming the delivery of health care by improving the quality of care and reducing costs. However physicians lack an incentive to invest since the benefits accrue largely to insurance companies and health care plans. The role of federal and state governments in establishing standards and providing financial resources for expansion of health information technology is another issue of importance. This background paper reviews and summarizes many of the issues that providers, payers and government will have to address in incorporating health information technology into the health care delivery system.

                                        Senator Sheila Kuehl asked the California Research Bureau (CRB) to provide analysis about the impact of two bills enacted in 2001: SB 221 and SB 610. These bills require local agencies to determine that a reasonably reliable water supply exists before approving new large projects including residential subdivisions with over 500 units, and large industrial and commercial projects. CRB estimated the number of subdivisions and dwelling units that were subject to these two bills from 2004 to 2006, estimated the amount of water used by these subdivisions and evaluated how the estimates would have changed if the law were lowered to apply to subdivisions with over 250 units. CRB also estimated water use in large industrial and commercial projects.

                                        More than 5 million people nationwide are infected with HCV; including 600,000 Californians. Due to the insidious nature of the virus, it is believed that fewer than half of them know they are infected. For many individuals the infection is discovered after the development of advanced liver disease, leaving some patients with no treatment option other than a liver transplant. Even when discovered early, the costly, often debilitating treatment process is successful in less than half the patients who are treated. The paper begins with a brief overview of the discovery of a hepatitis-related virus in the blood supply and how the cause of the virus, now known as hepatitis C, was discovered. The overview continues with detailed discussions of the risk factors and sources of infection for HCV, the diagnostic process, pathways of disease progression, and potential treatment options. A review of the prevalence and the direct and indirect costs associated with HCV are also included. The second half of the paper contains detailed discussions of the policy issues related to HCV including disease tracking and surveillance, a historical timeline of prevention and control efforts, workers compensation and presumptive infection, and access to care and insurance.

                                        The aerospace industry includes the manufacturing sectors of: aircraft and related parts; guided missiles, space vehicles and related parts; and, search, detection, and navigation instruments. This industry is important because it contributes significantly to the economy of the state, provides a number of well-paid jobs and is a spring board of innovation for other sectors. This paper includes a section on the history of California aviation and aerospace to emphasize the historical importance of this industry in California. The presence of the aerospace industry in the state is still strong. A significant proportion of aerospace electronic components and parts are produced in California and the state has a leading role in space activities and programs. California can enhance the competitiveness of its aerospace industry by offering (as other states are doing) a variety of incentives discussed in this paper. One of the industry's main challenges is that its current workers are approaching retirement age and it will be difficult to replace them, since the pool of labor with the skills required by aerospace activities is limited. Hence, the support of development programs that enhance these skills in the labor force is important.

                                        The Chair of the Assembly Banking Committee requested that the California Research Bureau prepare estimates of the number of housing foreclosures in California. Our estimate of the number of housing foreclosures in the State during the current cycle (2006 - 09), varies from 170,000 to 434,000. Foreclosures will affect between 3.0 and 7.8 percent of all homeowners with mortgages (depending on the underlying assumptions, as discussed in the Note). CRB also presents a range of estimates for metropolitan counties. As the credit and housing crisis plays out, CRB plans to update this Note and publish similar quarterly estimates throughout the year.

                                        Homeless youth are a hidden population. To shed light on this group of vulnerable young people, CRB conducted a survey in which homeless and formerly homeless youth completed over 200 interviews with their homeless peers across the state. The youth interviewed describe their experiences - how they became homeless, what life on the street is like, their interactions with police, their education and aspirations, their mental health experiences, how they go about getting help &ndash; the services they need, and the changes they would like to see happen in policy or law. The majority come from the hardest-to-reach and least-studied homeless populations: youth who sleep on the streets or in cars, squat in abandoned buildings, or "couch-surf." Most left their families because of violence or abuse or were kicked out, and many are surviving on the streets in the neighborhoods in which they grew up. This report presents the survey responses and findings. It is a primary component of the California Homeless Youth Project, a major research and policy initiative undertaken by the CRB and California Council on Youth Relations, with support from The California Wellness Foundation, to bring attention to the serious issues facing homeless youth in the state.

                                        Student loans are a rapidly growing $85 billion a year industry fueled by the substantial higher economic returns associated with a college education, increased demand from students and their parents, and grant and scholarship funds that have not kept pace with rising school tuition and fees. This report describes federally subsidized and guaranteed loans, examines the private student loan industry, and discusses issues relating to student debt and financial counseling. We describe practices that have led to allegations and findings of fraud and abuse in the student loan system, and recent federal and state legislative and administrative responses. The report was requested by Assemblymember Sally Lieber in order to better understand the national student loan scandal and responses to it.

                                        This report, which was requested by Assemblymember Loni Hancock, Chair of the Natural Resources Committee, examines the legal limitations on ex parte communications between board commissioners and interested outsiders on the following state boards and commissions: California Air Resources Board, Integrated Waste Management Board, State Water Resources Control Board, California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission), Public Utilities Commission, California Coastal Commission. Ex parte communications are made in private between an interested party in a decision-making process and an official in a decision-making position. Because they can introduce an element of bias in a decision-making process and violate basic due process requirements, state law generally requires that the involved officials publicly disclose ex parte communications in an open meeting. However the legal requirements and practices for the six boards and commissions analyzed for this report vary, and the public disclosure process evidenced in their meeting minutes is uneven. This report available for download is the revised edition.

The survey found that despite $63.5 billion in unfunded public employee pension liabilities, public retirement systems are recovering from the impact of the downturn in the financial markets that occurred in the early 2000s. California public retirement systems' aggregate funded ratio (the total assets that the systems hold in trust funds to pay benefits relative to the expected cost of benefits they are obligated to pay) is higher than it was in the early- to mid-1990s.

                                        The image of a "bounty hunter" bringing to justice a runaway fugitive is often glorified in the media and by the movie industry. Bounty hunters are depicted as "maverick" law enforcers who operate on the fringe of the criminal justice system to capture the most wanted criminals, in exchange for a reward. However critics maintain that loose state regulations foster abuse by bounty hunters, allowing them to act more like the outlaws they pursue than law enforcers. Why do bounty hunters have such broad authority to operate? What are their qualifications? What is their relationship to the American criminal justice system? How do they operate in California and what is the impact of the recently enacted Bail Fugitive Recovery Persons Act? These are the issues considered in this report, which was mandated by AB 2238 (Chapter 166, Statutes of 2004), authored by Assemblymember Spitzer.

                                        This report will provide an overview of legislative and gubernatorial efforts to increase the number of Californians with health insurance. It will review the state's health care policy for the medically indigent for the period from 1918 until the present, and will describe legislative proposals to increase the number of insured. The review will also indicate whether the proposals were financed by regressive or progressive revenue taxes, fees, or insurance premiums. Over that period, legislators introduced at least 44 measures to reduce the number of medically uninsured people in California. There also were four ballot measures that would have increased health care coverage.	The following changes were made to this report on November 29, 2007: On page 13, the report indicates Governor Warren began his first term as governor in 1944; he became governor in 1943. On page 18, AB 605 is identified as being authored by Assembly Member John Burton; it was authored by Phillip Burton.

                                        Most homeless youth who are on their own are not in school. Yet the majority of homeless and formerly homeless youth recently surveyed by the California Research Bureau expressed the desire to return to school and have life goals that require extensive education to achieve. This report discusses key issues related to the challenges homeless youth face in achieving their educational goals. It describes federal and state programs and funding, identifies successful practices and model programs, and presents policy options that address these challenges.

                                        As foreclosure rates rise, home sales slump, and new building continues to slow, economists are trying to estimate how many potential homebuyers there are in order to estimate the number of years the turnaround in the housing market will take. Projections vary depending upon the population data used - either the State of California's department of Finance Demographic Research Unit's or the Census Bureau's. This article explores how differences in the number of people, number of homes, vacancy rates, and household size impact the forecast.

                                            Children are often overlooked when their parents are arrested, but they are traumatized by the impact of this arrest on both their immediate circumstances and long-term care. Recent legislation by Assemblymember Pedro Nava encourages a coordinated local response by law enforcement and child welfare services, and requires the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) to develop guidelines and training for use by state and local law enforcement officers encountering children at an arrest scene. This report explores how these coordinated responses can best ensure children's safety and well-being and can also have benefits for both law enforcement and child welfare services. It highlights the successful joint protocols developed by several California jurisdictions and identifies key strategies for developing these approaches responses elsewhere in the state.

                                        For local governments in California, redevelopment is one of the principal tools available for revitalizing areas that are physically or economically blighted. In recent years, however, critics have raised questions about the value of some redevelopment projects, the use of tax increment financing which diverts increases in local property taxes away from other local taxing entities, the use of eminent domain to support private development, and questionable declarations of blight made by redevelopment agencies. Some have called for increased oversight of redevelopment agencies. At the request of Assembly Member Chuck DeVore, this report examines possible solutions that might increase local input.

Particular attention is given to firms with less than 100 employees and those with less than five employees. The paper also describes federal and California credit programs. Data show that angel investors, who have traditionally played a key role in early stage capital financing, are getting more organized and sophisticated. If angel investors' decisions start to mirror those taken by venture capitalists, businesses in early stages of development may lose this important source of capital.

                                        The federal government encourages health insurance coverage mainly through incentives in the Internal Revenue Code. These federal tax incentives for individuals and employers have played an important role in determining who has health insurance and characteristics of that insurance. As policymakers seek to reduce the number of uninsured, it is necessary to understand federal tax incentives and their effects on health insurance coverage. This report briefly describes federal tax incentives for health insurance and their combined implications for costs and coverage.

The purpose of this report is to examine the evolution of key provisions in California's tribal-state compacts. This information should be useful to state policymakers and other interested parties if, as seems likely, there are more successful negotiations to expand tribal gambling in the future.

                                        The desire to develop land in the vicinity of airports, and the continuous need to make improvements and expand airport capacity, are two opposing forces that shape airport operations and expansion. This report is the result of Senator Christine Kehoe's request that the California Research Bureau examine opportunities and challenges faced by airport operators throughout the state as they cope with pressures to expand operations to meet future demand, while dealing with local land use impacts including noise, traffic and compatibility issues. The report includes data on airport ownership, governance, management, operations and revenues, and current airport land use compatibility planning efforts at 13 of California's commercial airports as well as Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix and Oregon's Portland International Airport.

                                        This report responds to a request from Assemblymember Wilma Chan, Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, to research what happened to California's hospital certificate of need (CON) program. For over 30 years, the state and local planning agencies were involved in analyzing and approving the construction and expansion of health care facilities and services, based on a determination of community need. The goals were to ensure access to quality health care and to contain costs by restricting excess hospital capacity. This report discusses the history of California's CON program as well as key findings from other states.

                                        The residency of convicted sex offenders released from confinement continues to be an issue of public concern. This report was requested by California Assembly Member Mark Leno, and examines local ordinances and state statutes across the country that restrict where a sex offender may legally live, and the constitutional implications of such restrictions. The report also discusses comprehensive risk assessment tools identified by the latest research.

                                        Assembly Bill 63 (Chapter 915, Statutes of 2001) permits the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) to disclose specified income tax information to tax officials of any California city under a written agreement between the city and FTB. The records disclosed are limited to information identifying taxpayer filing business income from any California city: the taxpayer address, Social Security or taxpayer identification number, and business activity code. The cities can use the FTB data to identify businesses that might be subject to a local business license fee or tax. This report describes how the FTB and cities are conducting the AB 63 program, addresses data security issues, identifies the extent of participation by cities, describes the results of a survey of participating and non-participating cities on the efficacy of the program, chronicles the program legislative history, summarizes examples of local/state/federal data sharing, and obtains feedback from interested organizations on the AB 63 program.

                                        Millions of residents and tourists use California's public beaches each year to play in the sand and surf. Dog advocacy groups and dog owners are increasingly lobbying for a share of the beach to enjoy the same activities with their canine companions. However, whether dogs should be allowed on beaches is an issue that engenders strong feelings. Assemblymember Ted Lieu, requested that the California Research Bureau (CRB) conduct a study of dog beaches in the state. This report identifies beaches along the California coast that allow dogs both on and off-leash. It also identifies relevant state statutes and regulations pertaining to dogs on beaches, and discusses the major concerns associated with dog beaches-habitat, health, safety, liability and cost.

                                        Electronic government (eGovernment) has become a basic function of state government. California's state web portal (www.ca.gov) was award-winning on its debut in 2001, but has not been maintained and was recently ranked in the bottom five state websites nationally. This report identifies the primary policy and management issues that California needs to address to achieve a state web presence that is focused on customer needs, trusted by the public, accessible and usable by California's diverse citizenry and business communities. The state's website must be flexible to accommodate changes in administrative environment, customer expectations, and new technologies. Issues also include effective governance and sustainable funding. J. Clark Kelso, State Chief Information Officer, requested this report as part of his and the State Portal Steering Committee's efforts create an integrated, enterprise state web presence.

                                        <em>Barbara Steel Lowney, Masters of Public Policy &amp; Administration Intern (CRB-06-002, February, 2006)</em><br />
                                        Despite significant advances in public health and health care, the health status of most racial and ethnic groups in California continues to lag. Illness and injury generate tremendous social costs in the form of lost productivity and expenditures for disability, workers' compensation, and public benefit programs. A healthy and productive California will increasingly require the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities by improving the health of all groups. This report was developed as a resource tool for addressing racial and ethnic health disparities in state programs. It reviews programs in four California departments &ndash; Health Services, Education, Mental Health, and Transportation. These programs provide services in eight areas: Cardiovascular Disease; Breast Cancer; Cervical Cancer; Diabetes; HIV/AIDS; Asthma; Mental Health; and Trauma. The report describes how these programs are currently addressing and measuring health disparities through program design, data collection and program evaluation.

                                        This report was requested by Assemblymember Mark Leno, Chair of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, in order to assist the committee in its examination of California's penalty assessment structure. Penalty assessments are based on the concept of an "abusers fee," in which those who break certain laws help finance programs related to decreasing those violations, and they annually generate millions of dollars. County courts impose various fines, fees, surcharges, and penalty assessments on criminal offenders and traffic violators. This money is collected and distributed to victims and a variety of state statutory programs. Our survey of county courts and county clerks found that traffic violations account for around 86 percent of all funds collected, but that many courts are unable to identify the source offenses that generate penalty revenues. There are a number of actions the State could take to improve debt collection and simplify the penalty distribution process, discussed in the Options section.

                                        This report provides information on (1) the availability of biomass, (2) potential for cellulosic ethanol production in California, and (3) federal and state policies that support the use of biomass, particularly for ethanol production. There is a large amount of biomass in California. Nearly 90 million tons of biomass (agricultural residues, forest materials, and municipal waste) are produced annually in California, and 30 to 40 million tons are estimated to be technically feasible to collect and use in producing renewable electricity, fuels, and biomass-based products. According to energy experts, there is enough biomass to support the production of as much as 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol per year. However, the cellulosic ethanol industry faces challenges related to biomass collection, costs, price variability, competition from Midwest corn based ethanol industry, mitigating environmental effects, and the need of more efficient technologies for the processing of biomass to ethanol.

                                        This paper is an overview of issues related to ethanol, the most widely used renewable fuel in the United States. The use of ethanol may help to reduce oil dependency either in gasoline blends or as an alternative fuel. However, there is much controversy on some aspects of ethanol use that needs to be resolved, including the net effect of low ethanol blends on air quality and the relationship between the amount of fossil energy used in its production and the amount of energy ethanol generates.

                                        This report examines the various definitions for high school dropouts and graduates used by the California Department of Education. The report further compiles statewide data on high school enrollment by race and ethnicity, and provides details on enrollment data for the 10 largest school districts in the state. This report also summarizes the findings from previous educational studies on high school dropout rates and graduation rates. Each study analyzed in this report provides a slightly different method to calculate a graduation rate. The differences are described. Nevertheless, the major results appear consistent: 1) African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate from high school compared to Asian or White students. 2) Between one quarter and one third of all students fail to graduate from public high schools in California.

Topics include the use of the land, population and its characteristics, employment, and industry. Statistics are drawn from public sources, primarily federal and state, and displayed in charts for the region as a whole and for each of the counties in the region. The resulting picture shows a large, diverse, and rapidly growing region with an economy that is strongly agricultural while also encompassing a wide range of other industry and public and private employment. The region has a rapidly growing population, a trend that is expected to continue in the coming decades, and a large and growing Hispanic population. The region faces challenges of poverty and of educational levels that are below state averages, as well as the challenges of impaired air and water. A diverse, growing economy and growing population suggest that there are opportunities as well as challenges in the future of the region.

                                        State policymakers increasingly are seeking to strengthen public policy affecting youth by encouraging youth participation in the policymaking process. This trend acknowledges that youth have a lot to contribute by sharing their experiences and ideas. For example, youth in foster care have actively been advocating for program improvements. At the same time, there is a movement to better coordinate the wide array of youth services and programs offered by multiple state agencies. This report examines what California is doing to increase youth participation and improve services by involving youth and encouraging collaboration between state agencies. The report also describes the actions that other states are taking to improve state-level youth participation and agency coordination.

                                        Assemblymember John J. Benoit requested that the California Research Bureau examine the implications of allowing the use of Pay Cards for payroll purposes. His bill, AB 822, would amend the Labor Code to permit an employer to pay wages using a Pay Card if it can be used to access funds at an ATM in California with at least one free withdrawal per pay period. As we show in this report, there are a number of fees associated with Pay Cards that may be levied on employers and employees, as well as issues such as replacement costs and ensuring access to the full amount stored in the card.

                                        Young people who are transitioning out of the foster care and juvenile justice systems often have serious mental health needs. They can have many disadvantages working against them: families with histories of violence, mental illness, incarceration and/or substance abuse; learning disabilities or adverse neurological conditions; and histories of abuse, neglect or trauma. Some have ended up in the juvenile justice system, or on the streets, because of undiagnosed or inadequately treated psychiatric problems. The foster care and juvenile justice systems struggle to address the mental health needs of these young people, often with limited success. The purpose of the annotated bibliography of selected reference materials and websites is to assist policymakers in accessing useful reports, policy briefs, and other resources that examine the mental health needs of youth in the foster care and juvenile justice systems and the services provided to them. These resources, published in the last five years, provide information on a range of mental health issues and concerns facing these youth.

                                    <p class="indent">
                                        <em>Daniel Pollak (CRB-05-002, June, 2005)</em><br />
                                        Under current law, California's electric utilities and other electricity sellers must purchase 20 percent of their electricity from renewable energy generators by 2017. The state recently accelerated this goal to 2010. However, there are problems that make it challenging for non-utility sellers to meet the goal, including constraints on the transmission and delivery of electricity, and current policies requiring that renewable power be procured in long term power purchase contracts. Some of the state's utilities, as well as the state's non-utility retailers, are calling for more flexibility. Tradable Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) offer one way to provide this flexibility. A REC turns the "renewableness" of renewable energy into a tradable commodity that can be bought and sold separately from the associated electricity. REC trading can occur without regard to transmission constraints, provides an alternative to long-term power purchase contracts, and creates a new source of revenue for renewable generators. At the same time, REC trading also raises a number of difficult policy issues. For example, the REC market may not be sufficient to support the development of new renewable power plants and the currently available tracking system complicates efforts to guard against double counting. As a result, not all stakeholders agree the benefits are worth the risks. In addition to reviewing these policy issues, this report examines the experience of REC trading in other states, including case studies of Texas and Massachusetts.

                                        <em>Martha Jones, Ph.D. (CRB-05-001, February, 2005)</em><br />
                                        The Streamlined Sales Tax Project is a national effort to develop a standardized sales tax system. In November 2002, the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (the "Agreement") was approved by 30 states and the District of Columbia. As of November 2004, 21 states enacted legislation to reform their sales tax system in accordance with the Agreement. California became an active voting participant in this effort in January 2004. The next step is for California to decide whether to conform its sales and use tax laws to those of the Agreement. Preliminary analysis by the California State Board of Equalization indicates that conforming to the Agreement would require a major overhaul of the state's sales and use tax system. Taxes collected on sales throughout the state would be affected, not just taxes on sales made over the Internet. This report analyzes the impacts of joining the Agreement on the California sales and use tax system. The report also analyzes state revenue losses due to the inability to enforce use tax collection on remote sales (mail catalog and electronic sales). Advocates for the streamlining process argue that use tax compliance would improve if all states were to comply with the SSUTA.

                                        The Loma Prieta earthquake of October 1989 revealed the seismic vulnerability of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

                                        Every year in California hundreds of juvenile and adult sex offenders are released from prison and placed back to our communities on parole. Currently, as many as 50,000 registered sex offenders are under some form of community supervision in California. This report examines the process by which most sex offenders are released back into our communities and how that process compares to other states. The report also provides a detailed analysis on how California compares to the rest of the country in terms of its organizational response to sex offender management.

                                        Postsecondary education in California is a diverse system that includes public community colleges and universities, private nonprofit colleges and universities, and private proprietary/for-profit career colleges. Private for-profit institutions &ndash; businesses that prepare graduates for jobs and career advancement &ndash; are growing and serving an increasing number of adult students. The for-profit sector ranges from small owner-operated schools to an increasing number of large higher education systems that are owned and operated by publicly traded for-profit corporations, many with multiple campuses in several states. This report describes the for-profit educational institutions in California. It presents an overview of the external quality review system &ndash; a complex system that includes a private non-governmental process (accreditation), a state oversight function, and a federal recognition process, all of which address quality and consumer protection. It also includes a historical perspective and a discussion of current trends, issues, and policy implications.

We found that the proportion of out-of-school and out-of-the labor force young has increased somewhat between 1990 and 2000, particularly for young males 20 to 24. Most of the young neither attending school nor in the labor force are Hispanics, have lower levels of education, and are in the poorer income categories. In 2000, almost 16 percent of the four million young Californians were neither attending school nor in the labor force. In addition, four percent of them were unemployed.

                                        Each year, Californians dispose of millions of large metallic appliances &ndash; refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers, stoves, and similar items &ndash; most of which are recycled. The Metallic Discards Act of 1991 mandates that materials requiring special handling (MRSH) be removed and properly disposed of during recycling. MRSH include chlorfluorocarbons (CFCs), sodium azide canisters in unspent vehicle air bags, encapsulated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), used oil, and mercury found in switches and temperature control devices. Enforcement of the Act is uneven and there are likely widespread violations. Options to enhance compliance include recycling fees on the sale or manufacture of appliances, tightening the licensing of recyclers who handle MRSH, clarifying the language of the Metallic Discards Act, and increasing enforcement. Given the diffuse nature of the problem, heightened enforcement alone may not be sufficient without clarifying accountability and/or changing the economic incentives.

                                        Over the last 30 years, the loss of property tax revenues by local governments has resulted in an increasing dependence on sales tax revenues. Proponents of property/sales tax swaps argue that local governments on the whole would be better off with more property tax and less sales tax. One reason is to reduce the fiscalization of land use, which results in competition between cities for the sales tax revenue produced by big box retail stores. A second reason is that over the past 20 years, the property tax base in California (net assessed valuation) has been growing faster than its sales tax base (taxable sales). However, tax base growth rates for individual cities vary widely. This report includes graphs showing the growth in property and sales tax bases for 218 individual cities since 1980. Similar to statewide trends, net assessed value in most cities has grown much faster than taxable sales, and is also less volatile.

This report provides a brief history of adult education in California and describes the instructional programs offered today by the two main providers: adult schools operated by school districts and county offices of education and noncredit programs operated by community college districts. The report provides background information regarding federal and state funding sources and their structure. The report includes recent information regarding enrollment and demographic characteristics of students, as well as outcome, assessment, and accountability data. The report describes several policy issues, including the assessment of need for adult continuing education, the differences between adult schools and noncredit programs resulting from the difference in their governance structure, the lack of counseling services, and funding challenges. Finally, the report summarizes the findings emanating from the analysis and provides some policy options in the areas of: governance, delineation of function agreements, the California high school exit examination, qualifications for instructors providing educational opportunities to adults, data collection and reporting and standards, fee-based programs, monitoring of state funded programs, an assessment of need, counseling support, and funding.

                                        California currently has 1.17 million children, aged three to five, who are not yet in kindergarten. Close to half of the state's children in this age group are enrolled in preschool/childcare. This report examines the differences in enrollment rates by several variables including: the age of children, the number of parents in a household, the "linguistic isolation" of a family (which refers to the inability of persons aged 14 and older in a home to speak English "very well"), and family income.

                                        Most child nutrition-related research and programs focus on mothers as the primary influence on children's eating habits in spite of the role changes brought about by recent trends in divorce, single-parenthood, and joint custody. The California Department of Health Services, Cancer Prevention and Nutrition Section provided funds for a qualitative community research project on fathers' impact on their children's nutrition. The California Research Bureau convened a series of focus groups with fathers of young children. This report identifies the findings of the research to date and information gained through the focus groups.

                                        This report began with a request from the Schwarzenegger Administration to chart the history of executive branch agencies and their role of the governor's cabinet, and to summarize evaluations of their performance. The story is gleaned from musty government documents, contemporary press accounts, and dated textbooks. It is an important story. Who has the power to make and administer policy, how decisions are made, and how access to the governor is structured, matters a lot. To paraphrase Robert Dahl, democracy is about who gets what, when and how. This is why the quest to reorganize government is a complex and politically charged activity.

                                        California counties respond to the serious problem of domestic violence by offering services for victims and implementing graduated sanctions for batterers. The effectiveness of county efforts varies considerably. At the request of the Evidence to Policy Committee formed by the California Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the Health and Human Services Secretary Grantland Johnson, the California Research Bureau (CRB) surveyed county policies that address domestic violence. This report contains detailed information about individual county policies and administrative structures. In general, findings from the CRB survey indicate that many counties provide an uncoordinated array of social services to domestic violence victims. In many counties there is no assessment of local needs nor a shared vision between domestic violence service providers on how to best address the diverse needs of victims. This results in a fragmented programmatic approach that is less effective than it could be. In contrast, in many counties reforms in the criminal justice system have resulted in better coordination and sharing of information between law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and the court.

                                        This study responds to a mandate of the Legislature directing the California Research Bureau to study how California invests its surplus funds (money, such as tax collections, that is not yet needed to pay current expenses) and the degree to which these investments support California's economy (AB 2805, Assembly Member Papan, 2000). The study shows that since 1998 the Treasurer's Office has emphasized, to the extent that the law and the efficient management of the funds allow, investments that benefit California communities (such as time deposits, securitized business loans and mortgage-backed securities). The paper also discusses alternative policies that could be designed to direct these investments to California communities.

                                        The number of people under community parole and probation supervision in the USA reached 4.7 million in 2001. In California, this included about 121,000 offenders on parole and about 330,000 on probation. Parole revocation rates in the state are high compared to the rest of the country. For example, from 1990 to 2000 the revocation rate for California averaged 64 percent, compared to the national average rate of 40 percent. Why are the majority of parolees in California not succeeding while under supervision? Is it because of more stringent surveillance and supervision, or is it because of inadequate treatment and reentry services? This report examines the process by which offenders are released to probation and parole, reentry programs that transition offenders to parole, and program accountability measures to evaluate success. The report also provides a detailed analysis of recidivism rates among parolees, types of offenses and where they occurred.

                                        Long-term homelessness in California is a significant, complex, and expensive social problem. In addition to extremely low incomes, individuals and families who are persistently homeless commonly have chronic health, mental health, substance abuse or other conditions that make it difficult to maintain housing. Many homeless advocates and service providers support the expansion of permanent supportive housing &ndash; a combination of affordable housing and support services &ndash; to effectively address the needs of individuals and families who have been homeless for extended periods of time. Both the federal government and the State include permanent supportive housing in their strategies to address homelessness. This report provides an overview of long-term homelessness and describes the permanent supportive housing model, including funding sources, supply versus need, evaluation findings, and barriers and challenges in expanding permanent supportive housing.

                                        This report examines, from a practice and policy perspective, issues pertinent to the safety and well-being of children affected by the arrest of a custodial parents. As many as 13 percent of all adult felony arrests in California involve a custodial parent caring for minor-age children. Arresting officers are not mandated to report children at risk of being left without care or supervision to Child Protective Services (CPS). In some extreme cases, children may be left completely alone to care for themselves or may be placed with inappropriate and harmful caretakers.

                                        This report examines California law as it touches on the lives of prisoners and their children. Most prisoners are parents (79 percent of women and two-thirds of men in California prisons), making the state's criminal justice system an unwitting but important participant in the lives of their families. Law enforcement practices, criminal court procedures and sentencing laws, and correctional practices designed to catch, convict and punish prisoners have a major, but not generally well understood, impact on children. Yet state law provides very limited direction on how those authorities should interact with the families and children of prisoners. As a result, few agencies have clear policies.

                                        <em>Lisa K. Foster, M.S.W., M.P.A. (CRB-02-018, December, 2002)</em><br />
                                        Land use decisions are primarily a local government responsibility. However, federal and state fair housing and anti-discrimination laws provide protection for residential care facilities in neighborhoods so individuals with special needs such as physical, developmental, and mental disabilities can live and participate in the community instead of being isolated in institutional settings. Balancing the rights of individuals with special needs to live in the community and the rights of neighbors to preserve the integrity of their neighborhood result in a longstanding conflict between federal/state and local government requirements that impact land use regulation. The CRB report, Residential Care Facilities in the Neighborhood, looks at this public policy issue. It describes residential care facilities and residents; and identifies the relevant federal, state, and local laws that impact decisions about locating facilities.

                                        High-growth industries, the ones responsible for most of the economic growth in California, employ the largest share of the highly-educated workforce. However, in planning for the future, this report identifies two issues that policymakers may want to consider. One deals with the lack of adequate preparation of disadvantaged groups in California graduating from our high schools, an issue that has implications for the degree of employability in the high-growth industries. The other finding of this report is that employees (and their families) in small businesses, even those in high growth industries, seem to be at a disadvantage. Even highly-educated persons working in small businesses tend not to have access to health insurance and pension benefits at the same rate as large businesses.

                                        Domestic violence is a leading cause of serious injury to women. However, variations in the data sources and data collection methods make it very difficult to determine the magnitude and severity of the problem. In this report, the California Research Bureau presents data compiled from a survey of California's domestic violence shelters and programs, and identifies and analyzes data compiled by law enforcement, health care providers, and state surveys of women's health, in order to better understand domestic violence prevalence in California.

                                        This Note describes different states' approaches to creating programs for preserving historic and cultural resources. The five states highlighted each have a regulatory program to comply with federal historic preservation law. Some have created unique institutions that use a mixture of public and/or private money to carry out other cultural resource preservation programs. The Note then describes three "trust" models for historic preservation, including the British National Trust, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the New Jersey Historic Trust. Last, the Note concludes with a brief description of California's Coastal Conservancy, an independent board whose structure might serve as a model for creating an historic trust in California.

                                        The bioscience industries could radically transform virtually every aspect of our lives, from medicine to human reproduction, from industrial manufacturing to the food we eat. The potential commercial applications are so extensive that state and local governments across the country are eagerly trying to cultivate these industries as engines of economic prosperity. At the same time, concerns and fears in some quarters about the biosciences have led to controversies and calls for caution. The goal of this report is to provide an overview of California's biosciences industries, and to outline the actual and potential role of state policy with respect to these industries.

                                        Did the State of California enact laws that prohibited California Indians from practicing their religion, speaking their languages or practicing traditional ceremonies and customs? This report contains information obtained from public records related to four examples of early State of California laws and policies that significantly impacted the California Indians' way of life. These early examples include: the 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians; State of California militia laws and policies related to "Expeditions against the Indians" during 1851 to 1859; the California Legislature's involvement in influencing the U.S. Senate's ratification process of the 18 treaties negotiated with California Indians during 1851 to 1852; and laws enacted during the first fifteen years of statehood that accommodated Indian tribes' traditional fishing practices. California laws exist today that continue to protect fish and exempt California Indians from related prohibitions.

                                        Over 34,000 common interest developments (CIDs) provide housing for 8 million Californians. Several thousand new CIDs are built each year and they make up the majority of new housing being constructed in some counties. Despite their popularity, homeowners and professionals who provide services to CIDs have expressed ongoing concerns and criticisms. Some professional managers believe that many CIDs are financially unstable due to poor financial management, mostly due to board of director and homeowner lack of knowledge and expertise. We examined CID's financial management and other issues that could affect the financial stability of CIDs. Lack of reliable data on CID financial management practices and status makes it difficult to ascertain the extent of the problem. Nevertheless, despite all the existing laws, conflicts between homeowners, associations, and management companies regularly result in complaints to legislators for reform. This report identifies efforts by other state and local governments to address these issues.

                                        This report discusses the impact of the minimum wage, especially for workers who depend on these jobs for their living expenses. A majority of the 1.6 million workers (and their families) who earn less than $7.00 per hour work full time; hence, we assume that they depend on minimum-wage earnings to support themselves and their families. The total effect of the minimum-wage laws on the California economy is difficult to assess, but existing research suggests that the minimum wage is a relatively modest transfer program with relatively small economic effects overall. It may, however, be important to those individuals who benefit from minimum-wage laws.

It makes available to policymakers the latest information on the Census 2000. The first section of the report gives the traditional demographic profile of the total population. This section also includes a profile of children and of persons of retirement age. The second section of this report focuses on the two percent of the population that is in group quarters, i.e., correctional and juvenile facilities, nursing homes, and other institutions. The third section of the report provides information for housing units. It provides data on the total number of housing units in California and the reasons why some six percent of them are vacant. It also provides information by the characteristics of the head of the household. This information includes the percent of housing units occupied by members of the different ethnic groups.

                                        As a result of California's electricity crisis during 2001, policy makers scrambled to examine all possible options for maintaining a reliable supply of energy at a reasonable cost. Existing nuclear power plants within the state were very helpful during the recent electricity crisis. Four operating reactors at two nuclear power plants produce approximately 18 percent of California's power. To help legislators and analysts explore nuclear power's future role in California, this report outlines the benefits and risks associated with nuclear power.

                                        In the fall of 2001, the California Legislative Women's Caucus requested that the California Research Bureau gather information about local law enforcement and child protective services policies and procedures relative to the children of arrested parents. We surveyed California local police and county sheriff's departments and county child protective services agencies. Our findings suggest that the children of arrested and incarcerated parents (mothers and fathers) in California are in danger of being left in unsafe situations. The results can be tragic, as with the recent murder of Megan Mendez, left at age three with abusive neighbors when her single parent mother was arrested in Modesto on drug charges. How can the children of arrested and incarcerated parents "fall through the cracks?" In general, it is because key questions about the children are not regularly asked when a parent is arrested or incarcerated-a de facto "don't ask and don't tell" policy. Neither law enforcement nor CPS have the information they need to make a clear assessment of the numbers or appropriate placement of the children of arrested parents.

                                        The motion picture industry is an important part of California's economy. Concerns that California is losing film production to other states and countries have prompted calls for state action to retain the industry. This report reviews the causes of runaway production and describes the economic condition of California's film industry. Considerable evidence is at least consistent with the notion that production is increasingly taking place elsewhere. Attempts to quantify employment in the industry, its economic impact and the magnitude of runaway production, however, are hindered by a lack of reliable data and contradictory results.

                                    <p class="indent">
                                        <em>Daniel Pollak (CRB-02-005, March, 2002)</em><br />
                                        The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires public agencies to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for any project that will have significant adverse effects on the environment. Under �21080.5 of CEQA, certain state regulatory programs are exempted from this requirement because they have been certified as meeting criteria designed to ensure that they meet the basic goals of CEQA. This paper compares the laws and regulations of several certified regulatory programs to CEQA's requirements. The comparison shows that the rules governing certified regulatory programs in some ways correspond closely to CEQA. But as often, they lack some of CEQA's basic requirements.

                                        Today, over a million video surveillance cameras are used in the United States. They are deployed by schools to monitor student movement and detect illegal activity; installed at street intersections to catch cars running red lights; and positioned in public transit system buses and BART stations. In light of heightened security concerns following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, there has been very little public debate about the rapid diffusion of both Close-Circuit Television (CCTV) and biometric security systems to monitor the public. This report reviews how and where CCTV surveillance and biometric security systems are used, their potential effect on our First Amendment freedoms of speech, petition and assembly, and Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The report also analyzes pertinent sections of the newly enacted federal Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tolls Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the PATRIOT Act).

                                        Crowding has been increasing in California. This study looked at the determinants of crowding in California by examining demographic factors and measures of housing availability. Contrary to the general belief that crowding is mostly determined by housing market conditions, we found that demographic variables, particularly nativity (whether or not a person is born in the United States), were the most significant factors explaining crowding. Policy makers may be concerned about the relatively low level of housing construction in this business cycle, but they should not expect the level of crowding to change dramatically, even if housing construction is substantially increased.

                                    <p class="indent">
                                        <em>Jennifer Ruffolo (CRB-02-003, February, 2002)</em><br />
                                        In January, 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court limited federal authority to regulate isolated wetlands that serve as habitat for migratory birds or endangered species. The Court determined that the Clean Water Act's protection of wetlands only extends to navigable waters, their tributaries, and wetlands adjacent to each. Although we don't know the practical effect of the decision, it may produce a drastic reduction in federal regulation of vernal pools, desert springs, interior drainage streams, and other wetlands of importance in California. It may also mean the end of federal regulation of water pollution in these water bodies. The SWANCC decision presents California with the opportunity to assess the ecological and economic benefits of the state's remaining isolated wetlands, the costs of protecting them, and to determine whether the state should take the lead in their regulation. This paper reviews federal regulation of wetlands and the Supreme Court's decision. It attempts to identify the wetlands in California that now lie outside of federal regulation, and reviews existing state laws and regulatory programs that might cover the affected wetlands. It concludes with several policy options, ranging from minor fixes to plug the gap in federal-state regulation to creating a statewide wetlands conservancy.

                                        The state has a unique obligation to children in foster care. When it removes children from their parents, it takes on the responsibility to provide for their safety and well-being. There are over 100,000 foster children in California. Federal, state and county government spends over $2 billion annually for their care, and for services to foster children and their families. Foster Care Fundamentals provides a "big picture" overview description of California's foster care system. It is intended to give policymakers and others a working understanding of foster care.

                                        The California State Veterans Home in Yountville was the first facility in the state to provide nursing care to eligible veterans and their spouses. In 1996, the California Legislature authorized the Department to construct and operate new Veterans Homes in Barstow and Chula Vista. However, the state has had difficulty in maintaining the Yountville home at authorized bed levels. The Barstow Home actually operates at lower occupancy levels than the Yountville Home. With more Veteran Homes planned for construction, should the Legislature consider other methods for delivering and providing care to state veterans? This Note examines the types of services provided to veterans by state and federal agencies, alternatives to the model of nursing care provided to California veterans, as well as how other state veteran departments provide nursing care.

                                        Project labor agreements (PLAs) are arguably the most important change in labor-management relations in the construction industry in recent years. They have become a fairly common part of the organization of major construction projects in California. A PLA is a contractual agreement between a construction firm, sometimes the project's owner, and a consortium of labor unions. Each usually applies to only one construction project, usually a large one. Although PLAs have many complex and subtle features, the basic exchange is that the union agrees not to strike while the project is being built, and to use high-speed arbitration to resolve any workplace disputes that arise. The construction firm agrees to hire workers through a union hiring hall, with some qualifications, to pay union wages, and not to engage in "lock-outs" in the event of a dispute. This report recounts the history of PLAs in California, surveys the features found in California PLAs for both public and private projects, includes case studies of recent PLAs that are breaking new ground, and reviews the state of the President's PLA executive orders.

                                        Enterprise zones are California's second most important tool for attempting to resuscitate urban areas (after redevelopment). Businesses get generous tax benefits for locating and hiring in these areas. There are now 39 enterprise zones in the state, from Eureka to Calexico in North-South space, and from Central Los Angeles to Porterville, Delano, and Thermal in urban size hierarchy. The legislature regularly considers bills proposing to expand the number of zones. This experience costs the taxpayers over $70 million per year. So, do they work? A reasonable test would be whether there was more job growth than in comparable areas, and whether worker incomes went up. The results of our research show that during the 1990's, employment in enterprise zones grew on average twice the rate of the comparison areas, at least for a several year period when the tax incentives had their maximum effect.

                                        It has been over three years since California started implementation of welfare reform, officially known as the California Work Opportunities and Responsibility for Kids Act. Since the enactment of the law in 1997, 42 percent of welfare recipients have found jobs, unemployment dropped to the lowest rates in decades, and the state's welfare rolls have dropped by 43 percent. However, questions remain about the "hard to serve" &ndash; clients with multiple barriers to employment - many of whom probably need multiple services to succeed in the workplace. This paper focuses on the hard-to-serve population - those whose mental health, alcohol and other drug, or family violence issues may act as barriers to employment. The paper examines prevalence data and barriers to service. It also discusses exemplary local programs and provides policy options for county service integration, funding and allocation issues.

The Natural Communities Conservation Planning (NCCP) program was initiated ten years ago in Southern California as a pilot program to reconcile conflicts between endangered species and development. It has been frequently cited as a state and national model for conserving habitat on a regional scale. This report examines the results of the NCCP process, focusing on the two major regional plans that have been approved so far, in San Diego and Orange Counties. The report evaluates the NCCP planning process according to three criteria: feasibility, scientific basis, and acceptance of key stakeholders. The report finds that while the NCCP program has achieved some promising results, serious challenges remain before the process can be judged a success in the two cases studied here. See also the first report of the series (CRB-01-002, March 2001).

                                        Nationwide local government has been increasing the number of services that they contract out since the recessions of the early 80s and 90s. By the 1990's researchers have estimated that the average U.S. city contracted out 27 percent of its municipal services for a savings of between 15 and 50 percent. The proponents of privatization argue that it will improve service and lower costs mainly by encouraging competition. Opponents claim that privatization reduces important public services to a commodity and as such, quality will suffer as private companies try to increase their profits. Those against privatization also argue that private firms will only serve those that are easiest to serve, undermining the democratic ideals and values of our society. Fire protection has proved difficult to privatize, both because of community and firefighter resistance. There are no communities in California with private fire protection service. The State has a strong history of municipal fire service and private companies usually try to avoid communities with established municipal fire departments.

                                        This report reviews the history of kindergarten in California. It is an interesting story in its own right, one in which several women in California pioneered the kindergarten concept and contributed to a nationwide movement. The report puts current policy disputes over kindergarten into enlightening historical context. For example, kindergarten, inspired by precursor early childhood education concepts, included children from ages six and seven to as young as two and three. It sought to lead children gently "over the threshold of learning by the seductive charm of music, flowers, games, pictures, and curious objects." Later, kindergarten was integrated into the first to 12th grade system, gradually and subtly changing its focus to emphasize emergent literacy and early academic skills. An apparent consequence was that the minimum entry age was raised several times to its current level. This philosophical divergence is still not fully resolved.

According to the State Personnel Board, there are 172 chaplains employed in state government. Currently, there are over 172,000 adult and juvenile inmates throughout the state eligible to receive religious services. Religious services are also offered to more than 13,000 residents in other state government department facilities, including the Department of Mental Health, Developmental Services, and Veterans Affairs. In addition to chaplain workload and staffing issues, this study also looks at the range of services provided by chaplains to state inmates and residents, their organizational relationship and reporting responsibilities, and working conditions.

                                        Neither trade isolation nor international activism have become dominant directions in American public opinion on foreign trade. What has emerged is adoption by the public of a position best characterized by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations as "pragmatic internationalism." "Pragmatic internationalism" means that Americans are generally committed to an active trade and foreign relations role for the U.S. in the world. Despite polling limitations, the accumulated findings over the ten-year period reviewed by the California Research Bureau, support the view that the public is generally aware of both the positive and negative impact of foreign trade on their home life.

                                        Molds are essential components of our planets ecosystem providing decomposition of many organic substances necessary to plant, animal, and human life. However, it is also the case that excessive exposure to molds has been a health issue for humans for many, many years. The earliest known writings that appear to discuss mold infestation and remediation (cleaning up, removal) are found in the Old Testament. Molds have been implicated as the cause of a variety of health effects in humans ranging from minor allergic reactions and exacerbation of asthma, to brain damage. Molds have been found growing in private homes, office buildings, schools, automobiles, and other locations where organic matter and water are left unattended. This is not a new issue &ndash; just one which, until now, has received little attention by policy makers in the United States. This paper provides background information on molds, their potential health effects, and information regarding how they relate to indoor air quality.

                                        The first report in a series. The Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP) Act of 1991 was supposed to foster a new approach to conservation, one focused on preserving intact ecosystems across an entire region. The NCCP program was intended to provide development interests with a more predictable, streamlined regulatory process, while providing species with a more effective, ecosystem-based conservation strategy. This report reviews the legislative history of the NCCP program and its formative years of implementation, and notes several questions about the program's nature and purpose that remain unresolved. See also the second part of the series (CRB-01-009, June 2001).

                                        A mentor provides support and guidance for a child or youth in personal, academic, and other areas of life. As a public policy tool, mentoring is a positive youth intervention that reduces risky and negative behaviors. Mentoring has grown in popularity and is widely accepted as a valuable support for at-risk children and youth. This report examines the research literature evaluating the effectiveness of mentoring programs from 1995 to 2000. It explores the evaluation literature on traditional one-to-one, community-based friendship programs and on alternative models such as school-based programs. The report also identifies common themes in the literature: mentoring as one component of a more comprehensive youth development strategy; the impact of program infrastructure on effectiveness; and the need for additional evaluations.

For example, the interviewees range from former leading legislator Senator Leroy Greene, former State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, Michael Kirst, a leading academic in educational issues, and three former Executive Directors of the State Board of Education, and others. The major findings of this scan of experts are the wide range of opinions and lack of clear consensus on the underlying intent of the purpose of public education in California.

                                        Nearly 24 million Californians receive their medical care from a managed health care plan. These plans range from tightly structured health maintenance organizations (HMOs), such as Kaiser Permanente, to preferred provider organizations and physician group medical providers. Their goal of keeping health care costs low allows many families to afford the health care they need. Managed care has also inspired some controversy, particularly about health plan arbitration requirements. This report describes the landscape of health care plan arbitration in California.

                                        This paper shows in detail the federal and state options open to small business to raise capital in the private and public markets. The process of selling securities is very complicated and can be costly, as a maze of federal and state regulations of mind-glazing complexity must be negotiated. Each state has its own securities laws and regulations based on two alternative approaches: "merit review" or "full disclosure." California is a merit review state. The paper discusses the benefits of merit review and suggests that there are a variety of regulatory aspects that can be improved in California to facilitate the process by which small businesses offer and sell stock.

This report begins to look at strategies for raising the educational attainment of Latinos in California. The purpose of this paper is not to provide a comprehensive treatise on a particular issue, but rather to get the reader to start thinking about linkages that can occur across the different sectors. We need to not only consider the K-12 and higher education systems, but we must also look to preschools, economic development agencies, the private sector, community based organizations, and any other organization that can work with the community.

This CRB note estimates the number of children in California who have parents in the state's criminal justice system (jail, prison, parole and probation) and summarizes key findings from the research literature. Children whose parents have been arrested and incarcerated face unique difficulties. Many have experienced the trauma of sudden separation from their sole caregiver, and most are vulnerable to feelings of fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, depression and guilt. They may be moved from caretaker to caretaker. The behavioral consequences can be severe, absent positive intervention-emotional withdrawal, failure in school, delinquency and risk of intergenerational incarceration.

                                        Beginning in 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued a series of decisions that have tended to strengthen the ability of property owners to sue government for alleged "regulatory takings" of private property. Many observers have predicted that these rulings would have profound effects on the practice of land use planning and regulation by local governments. The purpose of this study is to investigate what effects have actually occurred in California's cities and counties. The report includes the results of a survey of California's city and county planners, as well as six detailed case studies.

                                        Focus groups are used widely in market and political campaign research (especially in initiative campaigns) and are thought to provide important insights.

                                        There is a digital divide in California. The probability of having a computer and accessing the Internet at home is related to: family income, the education and race/ethnicity of the head of the family, the age of the user, and the geographic area where the user lives. Education and income are the statistically most significant factors explaining differences in computer ownership and Internet access. Race/ethnicity matters regardless of income, education, age, and geographic area. Since disparities in income and education are significant and growing, expect the digital divide to close slowly. However, the good news is that once people have the equipment and Internet access, they use it, regardless of their socioeconomic differences.

                                        <em>Roger Dunstan &amp; Jennifer Swenson (CRB-v6-n07, November, 1999)</em><br />
                                        Construction defect litigation has been blamed for destroying the condominium market. Part of the argument, most often made by builders, is that the board members of condominium homeowner associations are easily persuaded by attorneys to file construction defect actions. The resulting settlements and judgements have raised the cost of insurance and made building condominiums unprofitable. The counter argument, most often made by plaintiff's attorneys, is that there has been a lot of shoddy construction. Supporters of this argument attribute many of the problems to the boom conditions of the 1980s when experienced construction workers were hard to find and less skilled developers entered the market. This note examines those claims and provides information on development in the condominium market

                                        This paper provides estimates on the number of children who are of pre-school age. In addition, it gives information on their ethnicity and family income. The following data show that minority children are far less likely to go to pre-school. This paper also shows that attending pre-school is a function of family income, since enrollment rates go up with family income. The analysis is based on the Census Bureau's 1997 October Current Population Survey on school enrollment. As with any survey, estimates are subject to sampling error.

                                        This paper shows how California has changed demographically since 1940. This paper contends that there are four major demographic shifts occurring in California. These are:<br />
                                        1) Natural increase is becoming the most important source of population growth.<br />
                                        2) Both types of net migration (domestic or international) have been important to the population growth of California. Between 1940 and 1970, net migration from other states was more important than international migration. From 1970 to 1998, the roles were reversed and international migration was the most important of the two.<br />
                                        3) Diversity is increasing at a very fast pace in California and by the year 2000 no ethnic group will be in the majority, i.e., comprise more than 50 percent of the population.<br />
                                        4) The proportion of persons 65 years and over is growing both numerically and proportionately.

                                        School districts in California generally respond to school violence in two distinct ways, according to a California Research Bureau survey. The most common approach is through violence prevention curricula whereby individual one-on-one violence and aggressive behavior is addressed through counseling, life skills building, peer mediation and conflict resolution. The other, but less common approach, is to make it physically difficult for terrorist acts to occur on school campuses by using a combination of highly visible security personnel along with detection technologies such as metal detectors and surveillance cameras, and more conventional security measures such as canine searches, locks, and metal bars. Few school districts are prepared to deal with a catastrophic event, such as taking of hostages or a tragedy such as that at Columbine. These and other findings from the survey raise important policy questions.

                                        With the steady decline in turnout at the polls over the last 30 years, state legislatures across the United States have been working to develop innovative ways to make it easier to vote. One such alternative is the vote-by-mail system) or all-mail-balloting, which essentially eliminates the use of the polling place, conducting entire elections by mail. This paper looks at vote-by-mail, and its advantages and disadvantages and some of the implications of using this system could have for California's electorate.

                                        On June 2, 1998, the people of California passed Proposition 227, a voter imposed statutory amendment that substantially altered the manner by which non-English speaking children learn English in California's public schools. This paper examines Proposition 227 and the driving forces behind it. Beyond the initiative itself, this paper discusses California's diverse population, and the dynamics that public schools face each day as they struggle to educate an increasing number of English language learners. This paper also provides a history of language policy, discusses how over time instruction in English became dominant for new immigrants, and presents a summary of why initial bilingual education policies were enacted nationally and in California. Beyond this history, there exists a limited body of literature on instructional programs for English learners. This paper discusses that literature, along with an explanation of the relationship between brain development and second language acquisition and learning, as a possible way to shed light on effective teaching methodologies used for English language learners.

There are two factors that have recently directed the attentio of policy makers to aerospace. First, the role of this industry in the state's economy has changed significantly during the last decade. This is a consequence of a series of structural transformations that this sector has carried out to respond to sharp reductions in defense spending and commercial aerospace purchases. Second, the growth potential of aerospace and defense-related markets is still good, particularly for commercial space activities and other new product applications such as global positioning systems.

It discusses how current statutes do not clearly define their functional responsibilities, and how this lack of clarity has caused conflict. This paper also examines governance models used in other states. It concludes with a series of options that the Legislature and Governor may wish to consider for restructuring the governance and administration of K-12 education in California.

                                        California state government has experienced several major computer debacles over the last several years. It is plausible that part of the explanation lies in the state's personnel system. For this reason, the California Research Bureau was asked to examine the state's information technology (IT) staffing structure. CRB interviewed the top executives of six California companies in order to present a general model of corporate IT employment practices. Case studies describe corporate IT "job families" by function, and examine IT compensation, recruitment, retention and training practices. In the second section, the report describes state IT employment practices in these same areas. The result is a useful comparison of private and public sector practices.

                                        At the request of Senator Richard Polanco, this paper looks at the educational attainment of Latinos, the largest minority group in California. This group, which comprises 28 percent of the labor force, is growing in numbers and is expected to be the largest group of workers by the year 2025. The earnings and the tax base that they represent therefore are vital to the state's economy. This report alerts policymakers to the fact that the wages of Latinos are not in parity with their numbers; therefore, neither are their tax contributions. Why do Latinos earn significantly less than other ethnic groups in California? Although there are several factors that determine the earnings of a person, the most important reason for Latinos earning relatively less is that they have lower levels of educational attainment. Some might argue that this is a problem of immigrants. This paper shows, however, that the low levels of educational attainment persist for even third generation Latinos. Relying on time alone to take care of the problem does not appear to be the best prescription. This paper looks at the benefits, in terms of earnings and the tax base, of increasing the educational attainment of Latinos, both in the long-term and in the short-term.

                                        The Africanized Honeybee (AHB, sometimes called "killer bee") is a highly defensive and aggressive cross between the familiar European honeybee and an African variety imported into Brazil for experimental purposes. After a long trip northward, Africanized honeybees have become established in California. Entomologists and agricultural officials now consider AHB to be present, if not fully established, in Imperial, Kern, Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties. Although the agricultural impacts can be managed, at a cost, risks to people and animals will remain and will require ongoing education, preparation, and action.. This paper reviews the situation and outlines some policy options to help cope with the arrival of AHB in California.

                                        Total Maximum Daily Loads, or TMDLs, may prove to be the most important change in environmental law in California since the Endangered Species Act, and the most significant change in water quality control since the Clean Water Act itself. The federal Clean Water Act requires California to establish TMDLs, but exactly how this TMDL requirement is going to work is far from clear; almost everything about it is cloaked in controversy or at least ambiguity. However, the weight of court decisions from around the country and especially in California suggest that water quality regulation is in the process of changing in quite fundamental ways.

                                        In California, seven million persons are without health insurance. Of these seven million, close to 2 million are children under the age of 19. To reduce the size of the problem, the State of California began offering health insurance to uninsured children in families with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The coverage is provided through two programs, Medi-Cal and Healthy Families. This paper looks at options for extending the program. It provides estimates on the number of new persons who would qualify and it gives an approximation of how much it would cost the State of California to extend such coverage.

                                        To determine the consequences of the ERAF transfers for California Citizens, we conducted a survey of selected California counties . . . .

It discusses how the Board, which was established in 1947, has evolved during the past five decades from one that set policy for various loan programs to one that today sets policy for grant programs . . . . Proposition 1A forges a partnership between the State and school districts for financing the construction and repair of their schools . . . .

The first report was the Governance of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California: An Overview of the Issues.

It begins by exploring why some people contemplate changing MWD's governance. It then explores the three questions posed in the previous report. This report concludes by examining six optional governance structures for MWD.

                                        Welfare reform makes connecting welfare recipients to jobs a high California priority. This report explores one approach to assisting recipients to find, qualify for, and hold on to jobs: temporary employment. The temporary help industry has long experience in linking new, often untrained people to jobs. It may offer an important mechanism to help welfare recipients gain work experience while being paid, and to develop "soft skills" such as a positive work attitude, getting to work on time, taking the initiative, and proper grooming.

The content, form, and direction that this issue takes will have a profound effect on California's biotechnology industry. "Inventing Biological Organisms: A Reader of Selected Articles" pulls together 48 articles, papers, and excerpts from books to address three fundamental issues: the ethics of patenting human DNA, biological organisms, or their parts; how individual, community, multinational, and national ownership of human DNA and organisms affects the development of biotechnology; and the economic advantages and disadvantages of patenting.

                                        For decades, the county probation system has served as a "safety valve" to control the flow of convicted offenders into the county jail and state prison system. Today overcrowded jail conditions are placing enormous pressure on county probation departments to supervise and manage more juvenile and adult high-risk offenders than ever before, with declining resources. In addition, the general public is expressing concern that the low-risk juvenile and adult offenders who often remain free and unsupervised while on probation be held accountable for their crimes. At the request of the Office of Criminal Justice Planning (OCJP), the CRB developed this Probation Policy Paper in consultation with the California Council on Criminal Justice.

                                        The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires a state-tribal compact for certain types of games on Indian lands. Proposition 5 would establish such a compact in law. The Initiative statute directs the Governor as a ministerial act to sign a compact. The compact would allow gaming devices and other card games to be played in tribal casinos. The tribe would be the primary regulator of the casinos and the state can assume some regulatory duties. This briefing paper provides background on Indian gaming, a summary of the initiative's provisions, and an analysis of some of the major issues.

                                        Education reform is currently one of the top public policy issues, both nationally and in California. Unlike past reform efforts, much of the current research is focusing on the qualifications of K - 12 public school teachers. Numerous recent reports indicate that the shortage of well-trained, fully qualified teachers is significantly affecting student achievement. Furthermore, these reports provide specific recommendations for how to improve teacher quality in four areas: recruitment, retention, preparation, and professional development. This paper describes the current issues in each of these areas, and the common recommendations of the various reports and studies. In addition, this paper lists legislative efforts from the 1997-98 session, and outlines further policy options for consideration.

Adopting the framework of "form follows function," the report focuses on: (1) What MWD's job is and is not; (2) What is best suited to ensure MWD does this job properly; and (3) How those in charge should make decisions. The report finds that there is no consensus among MWD's member agencies of what is and is not MWD's proper role in providing water to Southern California. Furthermore, it is this lack of common purpose that has led to many of MWD's internal conflicts.

Farmworkers play a significant role in one of the state's most important industries. Their working conditions are difficult; they have low earnings, poor or no health benefits, substandard housing, physically taxing and sometimes unsafe work conditions, and long hours.

California's prisons spend around $500 million each year on health care for inmates, up from $310 million in 1992. This rapid cost growth, together with a series of court decisions critical of health care provided, attention from news media, and legislative interest, have focused attention on correctional health care. This paper examines several aspects of California's prison health care experience.

                                        This compilation of selected materials relative to no-fault divorce and its impact on children was gathered at the request of Assemblymember Martha Escutia, Chair of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A brief introduction relates the history of state grounds for divorce and state divorce rates. Other topics include demographic information on divorce rates and family composition, the impact of children, current comparative state legislation, proposals to strengthen marriage and selected articles which present divergent opinions about research findings and reform proposals.

                                        This two-part report estimates California's need for early-stage investment capital and reviews what other states have done to address similar problems. In the first section, Dr. Koehler estimates the early-stage capital need of rapidly growing companies (Gazelles) in California. This is followed by a look at how early-stage investment networks form. This section concludes with an overview of why state-sponsored early-stage investment programs succeed or fail, and some options for California. In the second section, Dr. Rosa Moller reviews the structure and experiences of early-stage investment in other states. All the programs cited involve an initial monetary contribution by the state for business capital investment purposes. The reviewed programs include publicly run venture capital programs and public/private funds that are for the most part privately managed. Dr. Moller provides charts summarizing alternatives for the design of a state-sponsored capital program and key aspects to be considered in the choice of program features.

                                        Common interest developments (CIDs) are residential communities - like condominiums, cooperatives and planned communities - where individuals own their unit and share part- ownership in common property. This paper provides a unified overview of the legal structure, historical trends, and governance of California's growing CID housing stock, and background on CID-related issues that might require legislative attention.

                                        Relatively little research has been done about the ethics ordinances and regulations that have been adopted by California's local governments.&nbsp; There is no repository that collects such ordinances (with the limited exception of campaign finance ordinances collected by the Fair Political Practices Commission).&nbsp; Although the Political Reform Act establishes statewide conflict of interest standards, gift and honoraria limitations, and financial disclosure requirements, many other ethical issues arise at the local level.&nbsp; For these reasons Senator Craven, who chairs the Senate Local Government and Ethics Committees, requested that the California Research Bureau undertake a survey of local ethics ordinances.&nbsp; This report presents the results.

                                        A key finding in this literature is that children growing up in more stressful environments are more likely to experience delays in cognitive and behavioral development.... Such delays, in turn, can affect long term outcomes for children including school completion, employment, teen pregnancy and childbearing, substance abuse, and criminal behavior.... The paper examines recent discussions of research into brain development, especially as it relates to cognitive and behavioral development before age five. These findings provide support for early childhood intervention programs.

                                        The explosion in Internet activity in the last decade has led to new regulatory questions for government. Internet commerce, in particular, is a growing area of interest. One of the issues with which state governments must now contend is Internet-related taxation. This paper addresses current state tax policy trends in two areas: Internet access and sales of goods over the Internet.

                                        This review of the literature regarding the appropriate age for children to begin school found several studies that show that there are no differences in performance between older and younger children in kindergarten, while other studies show that older students tend to perform better than their younger counterparts. Over time, several studies suggest that the initial differences encountered in kindergarten diminish, while other studies found that on average older children will outperform their younger counterparts. The review of the literature describes several underlying factors for differences detected (i.e., a child's gender, socio-economic status, preschool attendance, how a teacher perceives a student, and teaching method employed by a teacher, as well as other contributing factors (i.e., changes in kindergarten curriculum, use of testing, and delayed entry into kindergarten).

                                        Fraud in health care is likely to continue because of California's very complex market structure. The more complex the market, the higher the likelihood that a segment of the market is overlooked; false statements and bribery are major categories of fraud; repeated underutilization or undertreatment is an emerging category of fraud; and fraud control efforts on the private-payor side are undersupported.

                                        Push technology is a relatively new means for automating the delivery of news and information to computer "desktops" on the Internet and on internal organizational intranets. The push approach may have applications for State government as both user and provider of information. However, push methods also raise concerns about excessive bandwidth use and several other issues that may be important to government agencies considering the technology.

The report generally does not examine border issues, nor does it feature current events. Whenever possible, the analysis relies on state level data, providing a richer understanding of Mexico's complex and distinct regions. The reader should gain an appreciation of the challenges posed by Mexico's rapidly growing, diverse population, the country's depressed domestic economy and its troubled political environment.

                                        This report examines concealed handgun laws in different states and discusses the concept of self-defense. It also reviews research about the effectiveness of laws regulating how and when individuals may carry concealed handguns in public. Some of the key findings of this study are: (1 States with the least restrictive concealed handgun laws generally have higher violent crime and murder rates than states with stricter handgun laws, but no causal links have been established; (2) According to polls, the public generally disapproves of laws making it easier to carry concealed handguns; (3) People living in rural California counties are more likely to be granted a concealed handgun license than people living in moderate- to large-size urban counties; and (4) States with the least restrictive concealed handgun laws generally have the highest rates of guns exported to other states which are used in a crime, according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms statistics.

                                        California is a state of 32 million people, by far the most populous state in the Union. California is divided into various economic regions. One such region is the Central Valley, more specifically the San Joaquin portion of it. This area is composed of eight counties: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare. This is a region that holds a population of 3 million or 10 percent of California's population. This region seems small by California standards. The purpose of this exercise, however, is to show that the Central Valley ranks right up there with many states in terms of population, employment, and other socioeconomic variables.

                                        For some time, affirmative action has been debated in the political arena. Recent United States Supreme Court decisions, however, have prompted some commentators to suggest that the future of affirmative action will be determined by the courts, not the legislatures....The Supreme court has now made it clear that any government program...that creates a racial preference is unconstitutional, unless the particular preference "serves a compelling governmental interest, and is narrowly tailored to further that interst." On the other hand, Justice O'Connor, the author of the Court's most recent decision on affirmative action, took time in her opinion to reassure advocates for affirmative action that strict scrutiny is not intended to be "strict in theory but fatal in fact"... Yet a third perspective on the judiciary's role is credited to Lawrence J. Siskind, who argues that courts may actually by the biggest obstacle to ending affirmative action.

                                        California's arrangements for financing cities and counties are in turmoil again, as they have been each year since 1978 when Proposition 13 passed. These problems were highlighted recently by the bankruptcy of Orange County and the near bankruptcy of Los Angeles County. Since that decisive year, there have been major changes in where cities and counties get their funding and what they spend it on. This paper summarizes those changes, mostly through a set of charts....The aim is only to compile a modest introductory history.

                                        From 1987 to 1992, California suffered a severe drought. This paper reviews the methods that California's farmers used to cope with the shortage of surface water. It concludes that agriculture remained remarkably productive during te drought, but with serious impacts in a few areas of the state, that California is now especially vulneralbe to continued drought because of reduced ground water levels, hat ground water management is a growing concern, and that irrigation efficiency improvements alone will not solve water shortage problems.

The underlying data are fromt eh Controller's well-known reports...The aim of this paper is only to compile a modest introductory history in charts.

                                        This report concludes that the President's plan will hurt California relative to other states. California will bear more of the cost of the plan, primarily because of its large share of both U.S. defense spending and high-income taxpayers. The report also concludes that California will be impacted more by a gasoline tax than a BTU tax. A positive note is that the effects of lower interest rates will reduce the large mortgage payments made by Californians.

This summary includes a very brief outline of the framework under which general obligation bonds are authorized, gives deadlines for 1992 bond measures, tabulates bond bills currently before the legislature(including their amounts, purpose, and status), includes some history about bond proposals on prior ballots, and offers a bibliography for additional reading.

                                        <em>Kyra Caspary, Tim Kusserow, Jake Lavin, Maziar Movassaghi (Richard &amp; Ronda Goldman School of Public Policy, UC Berkeley-99-001, June, 1999)</em><br />
                                        California is determined to integrate technology into schools; however, simply placing computers in schools will not improve student achievement or learning. Implementing a technology program, one that incorporates technology into the curriculum, creates problems for schools because owning technology is expensive. The cost fo technology is not simply the purchasing price; it consists of a variety of costs that accumulate over the technology's "life." The total cost of ownership (TCO) for technology is the life cycle of costs for technology. These include: capital costs (hardware, software and facilities), administrative and operating costs (planning, upgrade, replacement, and technical support), and end user operation costs (staff development and user downtime). This paper assesses TCO for technology in K-12 schools.
