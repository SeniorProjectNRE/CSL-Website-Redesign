                        <ul>
                            <li>It is the central reference and research library for state government and the Legislature.</li>
                            <li>It provides non-partisan research to the Legislature and the Governor.</li>
                            <li>
                                It collects, preserves, generates and disseminates information ranging from California's priceless
                                historical items to today's online texts.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It advises, consults with, and provides technical assistance to California's public libraries, and
                                it directs state and federal funds to support local public libraries and statewide library programs, and services.

                        <h3>Some history</h3>
                        <p>
                            In 1850, California's new legislature, seeing that the state's facts, figures, and documents needed
                            to be in a central location, established the California State Library in the State Capitol. In 1917,
                            the California State Library established the Sutro Library in San Francisco from the private library
                            of Adolph Sutro.
