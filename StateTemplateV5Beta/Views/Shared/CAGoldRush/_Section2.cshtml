            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>The California State Library serves the people of California in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the central reference and research library for state government and the Legislature.</li>
                <li>It provides nonpartisan research to the Legislature and the Governor.</li>
                <li>
                    It collects, preserves, generates and disseminates information ranging from California's priceless
                    historical items to today's online texts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It advises, consults with, and provides technical assistance to California's public libraries, and
                    it directs state and federal funds to support local public libraries and statewide library programs, and services.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Some history</h3>
            <p>
                In 1850, California's new legislature, seeing that the state's facts, figures, and documents needed
                to be in a central location, established the California State Library in the State Capitol. In 1917,
                the California State Library established the <a href="/sutro">Sutro Library</a> in San Francisco from the private library
                of <a href="/sutro/Adolph-Sutro">Adolph Sutro</a>
